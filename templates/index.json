After meeting Andrew and getting to talk with him, he was professional, knowledgeable, and all around fantastic to work with. He is friendly no matter your experience or skill level. I learned a ton, settled on the kayak I will be purchasing, and will be making the 4 hour trek specifically to buy from him. Trusty Sail and Paddle sets a real example of why we need local shops!",
