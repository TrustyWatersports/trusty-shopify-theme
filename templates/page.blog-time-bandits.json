        "post_content": "<p>I recall an encounter with a customer who introduced me to the term \"time bandits.\" He was a military recruiter and emphasized the importance of guarding against those who steal your time without contributing anything meaningful or productive. As he shared his anecdotes and jokes, I couldn't help but notice the irony—he himself was engaging in the very behavior he warned against. I had a strong feeling he wasn't interested in making a purchase, yet I listened patiently. When he finished, I gently explained that the concept of time bandits was not something I acknowledged or agreed with. For me, every interaction holds value, and every story has its worth.</p><p>I often find myself in conversations with customers who apologize for \"keeping me\" or \"taking up so much of my time.\" My response is always the same: <strong>\"There is nothing I would rather be doing.\"</strong> And let me be clear—this is not just a line or a sales tactic to make people feel good. It's the honest truth.</p><p>While there are many aspects of my job that I find less engaging, like working on our website, creating orders, or managing inventory, there is one part that truly lights me up: interacting with customers. The opportunity to give my time to understand their needs, their wants, their limitations, their experiences, and their unique stories is one of the few things in life that genuinely captivates me. In these moments, I can focus entirely on them, not on how I'm coming across or any personal stakes I might have. It's about offering exceptional service and truly being present for them.</p><p>The notion of a \"time bandit\" stands in stark contrast to my approach to service. For me, every conversation is a chance to connect, to learn, and to offer the best experience possible. It's not a burden or a waste of time; it's the essence of what makes my work meaningful and fulfilling.</p><p>In the world of skilled trades, having the opportunity to work with a seasoned veteran is a true gift. These experienced craftsmen possess a treasure trove of knowledge gained from a lifetime of hands-on work. They understand the most efficient methods, the pitfalls to avoid, and the nuances that make a job truly exceptional. One of my favorite customers is a handyman and carpenter who finds immense joy in having an aging expert accompany him on a job. He jokes about not being fast or able to work long hours, but he values every lesson learned from these seasoned pros, even after 30+ years in his own trade.</p><p>I approach every customer interaction with the same mindset. It doesn't matter where our conversation leads; I see it as an invaluable opportunity to learn and connect. I've had customers unexpectedly shed tears because they were ready to open up but lacked a listening ear—someone detached from their struggles and not inclined to offer unsolicited advice. I've heard stories from customers caring for aging parents, grappling with the difficulties and pain of that role. Some have shared the profound grief of losing those parents and the journey to rediscover time for themselves. Others have recounted their experiences with retirement, whether by choice or not, and the emotional rollercoaster that accompanies such a significant life change. I've listened to customers who have lost a spouse and are now bravely forging ahead in search of happiness. And I've shared in the excitement of new loves blossoming from the ashes of past relationships.</p><p>Each of these experiences is a privilege to witness. They enrich my understanding of the human experience and deepen my appreciation for the unique stories every customer brings.</p><p>It's true that I'm a good listener. I never miss a beat; I never miss a detail. While this skill undoubtedly aids me in sales, that's not the heart of the matter. I feel deeply honored when someone confides in me, trusts me with their stories, and believes I can handle and appreciate the weight of their disclosures. Every single interaction is like an old timer teaching me the best way to work, and I listen, enraptured and eager to learn. <strong>None of you have ever stolen my time; instead, you have given me gifts—knowledge, experience, and insights that have enriched my life beyond measure.</strong></p><p style='margin-top: 3rem; font-weight: 600;'>Heather Fournel</p>",
